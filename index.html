       The Sacramento typeface is a monoline, semi-connected script inspired by hand-lettering artist brochure work of the 1950's and 1960's. It stands on a thin line between formal and casual lettering styles, yet it has a commanding presence for headlines and titles.
          </p>

            Ksenia Erulevich, the designer of the Alice typeface, was inspired by Lewis Carrol's novel and decided to make a typeface that will be suitable for typesetting that book.It came out eclectic and quaint, old-fashioned, having widened proportions, open aperture, and soft rounded features; perfect for long meditative text-setting and headlines.
This is in fact Ksenia's first typeface, as part of her diploma project in a Type and Typography course in Moscow, Russia.
Released by Cyreal with help from Gayaneh Bagdasaryan and Alexei Vanyashin.

            Nunito is a well balanced sans serif typeface superfamily, with 2 versions: The project began with Nunito, created by Vernon Adams as a rounded terminal sans serif for display typography. Jacques Le Bailly extended it to a full set of weights, and an accompanying regular non-rounded terminal version, Nunito Sans.
          </p>

PT Sans was developed for the project "Public Types of Russian Federation." The second family of the project, PT Serif, is also available.
The fonts are released with a libre license and can be freely redistributed: The main aim of the project is to give possibility to the people of Russia to read and write in their native languages.
PT Sans is based on Russian sans serif types of the second part of the 20th century, but at the same time has distinctive features of contemporary humanistic designs. The family consists of 8 styles: 4 basic styles, 2 captions styles for small sizes, and 2 narrows styles for economic type setting.

           The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. 
This is the normal family, and it has two sister families so far, Alternates and Subrayada. Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the Montserrat neighborhood.

The first Crimson design was initiated by Sebastian Kosch in 2009, and he later completely redrew a new version called Crimson Prime.
